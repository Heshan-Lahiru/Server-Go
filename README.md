# Server-Go
# MongoDB Go Project 🚀

This project demonstrates a simple Go application that connects to a **MongoDB** database and performs basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). The project also utilizes **pretty printing** for better display of MongoDB documents in the terminal.

## Features 🎯

- 🌟 Connect to MongoDB using Go's MongoDB driver
- 🔄 Perform basic CRUD operations:
  - Insert a document
  - Read and search documents
  - Update a document
  - Delete a document
- 🎨 Beautified terminal output using the `pretty` package

## Project Structure 📂

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version 1.16 or later)
- A MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)
  - You can use **MongoDB Atlas** for a free cloud-based MongoDB instance.
  
## Setup Instructions 📋

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-go-project.git
   cd mongodb-go-project

Install required dependencies: go mod tidy

## Setup Instructions 📋

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-go-project.git
   cd mongodb-go-project
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
Update the MongoDB URI:

Open main.go and update the MongoDB connection URI with your credentials.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
How It Works ⚙️
Insert a Document: A sample document with a name and email is inserted into the MongoDB collection.
Retrieve All Documents: The application fetches and displays all documents in the collection.
Update a Document: The email of a document is updated based on the name.
Search for a Document: You can search for a document by name.
Delete a Document: A document is deleted from the collection and the remaining documents are displayed.

Example Terminal Output 🖥️

Connected to MongoDB!
Inserted document with ID: ObjectID("61234abc...")
Documents in the collection:
{
    "_id": ObjectID("61234abc..."),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
Updated 1 document(s)
Found document:
{
    "_id": ObjectID("61234abc..."),
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.updated@example.com"
}
Deleted 1 document(s)
Documents in the collection: []
